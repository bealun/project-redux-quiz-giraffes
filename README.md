# Redux quiz group project

A interactive quiz built in teams with React.js and intro to Redux.

## Code
I've used:
  * **JavaScript**
  * **React.js**
  * **Redux**
  * **CSS**
  * **Mob programming**

## The problem
Set up a base for the team to use together with a base of seperate components to be able to work seperately. Divided the process in two - one for the questions and one for the navigation between start, quiz and summary.
